# string-equation-calculator
This is a calculator for addition and subtraction equations. It allows for parentheses, multi-layered parentheses,
and negative numbers. There is an upper and lower bound on the numbers at 100,000,000 and -100,000,000 respectively.
I decided against adding a pip library dependency to this project, so to exit do one of the following:
- Leave the input empty
- Put just a '0' in the input
- Type 'esc' in the input
- type 'escape' in the input

**Environment**
I am using Python 3.5.1, but any Python 3.5+ should work for running. This program does not require
and use of dependencies or other external resources

**How to run**
*Option 1:*
- Open a command terminal
- Run the file by doing the following command: '{path-to-python.exe} {path-to-folder-with-file}/calculator.py'

*Option 2:*
- Open an IDE
- Navigate to the folder where the calculator.py file is stored
- Run the calculator.py file

**How to use**
- Only enter numbers between -100,000,000 and 100,000,000
- Make sure parentheses are valid
- No letter characters
