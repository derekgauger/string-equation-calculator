Purpose: Bitnine Apache AGE 2022 Internship Program Coding Round
Description:
This is a calculator for addition and subtraction equations. It allows for parentheses, multi-layered parentheses,
and negative numbers. There is an upper and lower bound on the numbers at 100,000,000 and -100,000,000 respectively.
On the coding assignment sheet, it says to make the program exit on press of the escape key and the '0' key.
I decided against adding a pip library dependency to this project, so to exit do one of the following:
 - Leave the input empty
 - Put just a '0' in the input
 - Type 'esc' in the input
 - type 'escape' in the input
